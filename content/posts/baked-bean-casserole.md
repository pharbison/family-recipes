## Ingredients
- 1 Vidalia Onion
- 1 Red Bell Pepper
- 3 Garlic Cloves
- 1 lb Thick Cut Bacon
- 1 lb Ground Beef
- 1 Tbsp Cajun Seasoning
- 4x 15oz Cans Pork and Beans in Tomato Sauce(plain)
- 1/2 Cup Dark Molasses
- 2 Tbsp Light Brown Sugar
- 1/2 Cup BBQ Sauce
- 1 Tbsp Mustard

## Prep
1. Dice onion and bell pepper
2. Mince garlic
3. Cut bacon into 1" by 1/4" pieces

## Directions
Cook the bacon in a large pot. After bacon is cooked spoon the pieces out into a bowl lined with napkins. 

Pour your onions and bell peppers into the bacon grease and saut√©. Once they've become soft and fragrant add the ground beef to the pot. Cook until all meat is browned, then strain the meat to remove the excess grease. 

Add the cooked bacon and garlic back into the pot. Allow to cook for 3-5 minutes stirring occasionally. If needed add water to prevent from sticking to the bottom of the pot. 

Finally add beans, cajun seasoning, dark molasses, brown sugar, bbq sauce, and mustard. Cover on low heat stirring occasionally to allow flavors to mix.
