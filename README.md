# Source for recipes.pharbison.dev running on GitHub Pages
## Description
This website is meant to be very simple and host only recipes. Based on Hugo and the [Mini theme](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini.git) this website conforms to documentation created for those projects. 

## Adding Recipes
In order to add new recipes create a branch and add a markdown formatted recipe under `content/posts` following the same format as the other recipe files. Note that the recipe will not be displayed until after the date specified in the header. 

## Development Notes
The Mini theme was installed as a git submodule to ease updating the theme. Any modifications to the theme are added under the layouts folder.
