## Ingredients
- 2 cups flour
- 2/3 cup hot water
- 1 tsp salt
- 5 tsp fat (melted butter, oil, lard)

## Directions
Add flour to mixing bowl, mix in fat until crumbly. Add salt to water, stir into flour slowly until dough starts to form. Knead 2-3 minutes until well formed. Cover with tea towel or kitchen towel and let sit for 15 minutes to 3 hours. On floured surface, split dough into 10 even sized balls. Roll each ball out to about 8 inches. Preheat skillet to medium or medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes on one side until they start to puff up, then flip. Place on plate or dish covered by a towel until all are done, then serve. 

Dough can be kept tightly wrapped in fridge for 2-3 day. Bring to room temperature before cooking.
