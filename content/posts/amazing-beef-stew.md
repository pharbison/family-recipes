## Ingredients
- 1 lb beef or venison stew meat
- 3 medium red potatoes
- 2 cups diced carrots
- 1 cup diced celery
- 1 diced large onion
- 2 minced garlic cloves
- 2 tsp herbs de Provence
- 1 15oz can of diced tomatoes
- 32oz beef stock
- 4 dashes Worcestershire

## Directions
Ensure the sinew has been removed from the stew meat if using Venison. Start by allowing stew meat to saute in a large pot until a nice fond has built on the bottom. Remove the stew meat, and add the onions and garlic. Saute the onion/garlic mix until fragrant and onions begin to turn translucent. Next add beef stock, potatoes, carrots, celery, diced tomatoes, herbs de Provence, Worcestershire, and the stew meat. Add a generous amount of salt and pepper. At this point you should have all the ingredients in the pot.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cover for 1-2 hours until potatoes are tender. At this point the stew meat should also be nice and tender. Serve and enjoy!
